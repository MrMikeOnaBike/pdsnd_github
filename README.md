### Project Title
Project Bike Share Data

### Description
This is the bike share data project written in python.
The code allows the user to analyze the bike share data from several major cities.

### Files used
python code - bikeshare_2.py
data files - chicago.cvs
           - new_york_city.cvs
           - washington.cvs

### Credits
Udacity lessons on git command line and guthub.
Had to google "stage changes" and read documentation only to realize what I did wrong

This is the third edit of the file because the instruction said to do this 3 times. :-)


And in part 3 we are asked to change this file again.
I also added comments to the bikeshare.py file.
